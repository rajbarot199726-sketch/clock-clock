# Clock Clock

A super lightweight Chrome extension that keeps your local time in the toolbar badge and shows a tiny popup with:

- your country flag on top,
- your current local time below it,
- and your detected time zone.

The extension auto-detects your location by IP using `ipapi.co` and updates over time.

## Load locally

1. Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked**.
4. Select this folder (`clock-clock`).
5. Pin the extension to the toolbar to keep the clock visible.
